# Hypothesis Generation and Testing For Data Science Projects. 

Notes and projects on hypothesis generation and testing for data science and analytics.

As data sceicne and machine learning take up vital roles in solving complex problems in the business world, it is very important to understand the problem statement of a business and have proper knowledge of the business domain. In order to expose new ideas and solve these business problems, hypothesis generation and testing are the first steps a data scientist need to consider.


##  Intro, Definition and Reason

In general, a statistical hypothesis is a statement - an assumption - about the nature of a population and often stated in terms of a population parameter. Statistical hypothesis testing is a class of methods used to answer questions about the data under study or samples of a population. It is an analysis whereby assumptions about a population parameter is put to test. It helps data sceintists to accept or reject some assumption/claim i.e. a statistial hypothesis about the data and the potential questions that can be answered by the data.
